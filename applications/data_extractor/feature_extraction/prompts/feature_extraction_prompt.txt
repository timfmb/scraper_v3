Guidelines:
1. Extract information from the raw data, making reasonable inferences when appropriate
2. Convert measurements to the specified units when needed (metres, kg, litres, knots, hp)
3. Use null for completely uncertain or missing data
4. Country can be inferred from location
5. currency can be inferred from country and symbol
6. For condition, use 'New' or 'Used' based on context
7. MAKE_DETAILS is REQUIRED - always extract or infer the manufacturer/brand from the title, model name, or any context available
8. MODEL_DETAILS - always extract or infer the model name/number from the title, description, or any context available if possible
