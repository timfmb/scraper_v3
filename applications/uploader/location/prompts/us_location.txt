2. Check if the location string contains a real place that exists within the United States
3. Match the location to the most appropriate standardized US region from the list above
4. Return your response in this exact JSON format:

```json
{
    "country": "United States",
    "location": "[matched_standardized_region]",
    "country_matched": true/false
}
```

**MATCHING RULES:**
- Map cities/states to their correct regions based on geography and coastal areas

- Handle state abbreviations (FL, CA, NY, TX, etc.)
- If the location cannot be verified as a real US place, set country_matched to false
- If the country is not United States, set country_matched to false
- Always use the exact region names from the standardized list
